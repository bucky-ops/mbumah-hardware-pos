# MBUMAH HARDWARE POS — Worklog

Task ID: 1
Agent: Main Agent
Task: PHASE 1 — Fix Backend Systemic Crashes

Work Log:
- Assessed current project state: all 14 financial routes already use correct composition order `withErrorBoundary(withFinancialAuth(...))`
- Fixed `financial/payments/[id]/route.ts` — was MISSING `withFinancialAuth`, allowing any authenticated user to void payments. Added `withFinancialAuth(voidPaymentHandler, FINANCIAL_WRITE_ROLES)`
- Enhanced `transactions/route.ts` NaN guard: replaced `parseFloat(String(...))` with explicit safe numeric coercion + `Number.isNaN()` validation that throws clear 400 errors for invalid numeric fields
- Updated `validations.ts` checkout schema: changed `z.number()` to `z.coerce.number()` for all numeric fields (pricePerUnit, costPrice, quantity, taxRate, etc.) — auto-converts strings to numbers during validation
- Also changed `isRentalItem` and `isBundle` to `.optional()` in checkout schema since they may not always be provided
- Fixed debt calculation path in transactions POST to use `Number()` instead of `parseFloat(String(...))`

Stage Summary:
- Security gap fixed: payment voiding now requires senior roles (SUPER_ADMIN, STORE_OWNER, BRANCH_MANAGER, ACCOUNTANT)
- NaN propagation risk eliminated: all numeric fields validated with explicit NaN checks
- Zod schema now uses `z.coerce.number()` to auto-convert string-type values from frontend
- Files changed: `financial/payments/[id]/route.ts`, `transactions/route.ts`, `validations.ts`

Task ID: 2
Agent: Main Agent
Task: PHASE 2 — Fix Frontend Crashes & Defensive Coding

Work Log:
- Verified catalog-tab.tsx: ✅ Already properly guarded with `Array.isArray()` via `safeCategories`/`safeFilteredProducts`
- Verified debt-management-tab.tsx: ✅ Uses `||` fallback + optional chaining on `byBucket`
- Verified inventory-tab.tsx: ✅ Has `isError` + `refetch` + retry button
- Fixed security-tab.tsx: Added `Array.isArray()` guards on `dashboard.topIPs` and `dashboard.recentCritical` before `.map()` calls

Stage Summary:
- All tab components now have proper Array.isArray() guards
- Security tab partial guards upgraded to full guards
- Files changed: `security-tab.tsx`

Task ID: 3
Agent: Main Agent
Task: PHASE 3 — Fix Checkout Validation Error

Work Log:
- Fixed `page.tsx` `cart.addItem()` call: wrapped `pricePerUnit`, `costPrice`, `taxRate` with `Number()` coercion when adding product to cart
- Fixed `page.tsx` checkout mutation: mapped cart items to ensure all numeric fields are properly typed as numbers before sending to API
- Combined with Zod schema `z.coerce.number()` changes, this creates a three-layer defense:
  1. Frontend: `Number()` coercion at cart.addItem() and checkout mutation
  2. Zod: `z.coerce.number()` auto-converts any remaining strings
  3. Backend: `parseFloat()` + `isNaN()` guard for final safety net

Stage Summary:
- Checkout 400 "expected number, received string" error fully resolved
- Three-layer numeric coercion prevents type mismatch at every stage
- Files changed: `page.tsx`

Task ID: 4-6
Agent: Main Agent
Task: PHASE 4-6 — Purchase Orders, Seed Script, CI/CD

Work Log:
- Verified Purchase Orders: Tab component + API routes already exist and functional
- Verified Seed Script: Already includes 5 sample PurchaseOrders with proper data
- Verified CI/CD: `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml` exists with 9-stage pipeline
- Verified CONTRIBUTING.md: Already exists with Gitflow branching and Conventional Commits

Stage Summary:
- All infrastructure already in place from previous development phases
- No changes needed for these phases
